# Language Detector

This project is a web application for detecting languages using a Flask-based backend and a dynamic front-end interface. The application utilizes `googletrans` for language detection and provides a user-friendly interface for real-time language detection. Users can input text to detect its language, view the detection history, and interact with features like light/dark mode themes.
